# MIDI Step Sequencer in JUCE
This repository contains the source code and the documentation of a multitrack, MIDI step sequencer written in JUCE. This app allows the user to create melodic patterns and it will output a set of MIDI commands to trigger software or hardware synthesizers. The pattern can be played back in real-time or stored in the computer. The software was created using JUCE v5.4.3 and exported in Visual Studio 2017.
